## Laws of the process

```
It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
```
[--- Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)

```
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
```
[--- Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)

```
Organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained
to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
```
[--- Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

```
Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity.
The only question is: Who will have to deal with it â€” the user,
the application developer, or the platform developer?
```
[--- Tesler's Law / The Law of Conservation of Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity)
